## [Style Manual](http://stylemanual.org) ##

An incomplete, personal grammar reference. When something is in question, I plan to document the opinions of multiple books (and other sources), drawing my own conclusions and setting my own rules for style.


## [1140px CSS Grid](http://cssgrid.net/) ##

A responsive CSS grid system. They're everywhere now; however, it was one of the first. It astounds me how popular this still is.


## [Catching Elephant Tumblr Theme](http://www.tumblr.com/theme/7285/) ##

One of my first coding projects. It's a bit long in the tooth now (and incredibly poorly put together), but based on usage, it is/was quite popular. As of writing it has just over 250,000 installs.


## [Catching Zebra](http://blog.andytaylor.me) ##

My previous blog (2008--2012) is called Catching Zebra. I've imported a couple of my favourite posts to this blog; however, it will remain up for posterity.


## [Measure the Screen](http://andytaylor.me/measure/) ##

A basic tool to quickly check available screen resolution (particularly on mobile devices) regardless of pixel density.


## [Cheen](http://cheen.co) ##

Nothing more than an excuse to have some fun with `@font-face`.


## Old versions of this site ##

I've kept [version 2] and [version 3] of this site alive for posterity.
