title: Ghetto Coffee Roasting
---

I heard [Shawn][] and [Ben][] talking about roasting coffee in a popcorn popper on the [B&B Podcast][bnb]. So I decided to give it a shot.

I watch the [videos][sm] they linked to and quickly started searching for where to buy green beans in Melbourne. I found the [CoffeeSnobs Starter Pack][cs] which seemed good. They send you four random varieties of green beans to get started with. I then told my wife about the plan and she offered to sacrifice her [popcorn popper][popper].

## Roasting ##

Supposedly there's a first and a second crack. The first is supposed to be quite audible, the second not so much.

I did two batches, the first for 8.5min, the second for 11min. The first had a few under-done beans and some that looked perfect---a bit inconsistent. The second looked better---darker, with a more even roast.

I'm not even sure I heard the second crack either time. The first I probably stopped too early, as I didn't want to over-do it. The second time there was one or two cracks before I took them out, but they didn't sound any different to the ones from first crack.

Here's a [video of the first batch](https://vimeo.com/29655854), and a photo of the second:

## Next time ##

On the [Coffee Snobs Forum][csf] there's a whole lot of people making chimney's out of tin cans. I think I'll try that. The beans weren't exactly flying out of the popper, but I had to keep shaking it to keep a few stray beans in the chamber. A can would definitely keep them in.

## Results ##

Before roasting, the beans smelt alright, but not anything like coffee normally does. Straight after roasting they smelt pretty good---like coffee, but nothing to write home about. I went to have a look an hour later and they'd started to smell *really* good. In the morning they smelt even better and after I ground some---*holy shit*.

I made a short black first. I figured pure coffee with no milk or sugar was a good way to test it. [Shawn][] had said his first batch was about as good as any coffee he'd buy (which could only leave room for improvement). I'd say mine is a *bit* better than coffee I'd normally buy, and I'm convincing myself that it's even better again.

Very minimal bitterness, but still really strong and full bodied. I'd say batch two was a success. Time for another coffee.
