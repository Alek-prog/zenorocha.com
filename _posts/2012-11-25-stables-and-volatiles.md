This piece by Michael Lopp is primarily about engineering, but it speaks to the entire process of making 'things' in teams. 'Stables' are process driven; they want to make safe things, the right way. 'Volatiles' are disrupters; they live for making the next amazing thing.

This part particularly struck home:

> Once you're successfully past 1.0, you have a choice: coast and die, or disrupt. No one in history has ever actually chosen coast and die; everyone thinks they're choosing the path of continued disruption, but it's a very different choice when it's made by a Stable than by a Volatile. A Stable's choice of disruption is within the context of the last war. They can certainly innovate, but they will attempt to do so within the box they bled to build. A second-generation Volatile will grin mischievously and remind you, "There is no box."

You start a project with the craziest of ideas; some make it, some don't. You end up with a good---sometimes great---thing, and some baggage from the process.

Within the context of that project, you may never be a Volatile again. You've got your thing, now you need to maintain it, you need to gradually make it better. You couldn't possibly do *that* new feature with all that baggage, could you?

Will your thing ever be distinctly better unless you bring in some new Volatiles? Hopefully just being aware that you're becoming a Stable is enough to somewhat counteract the fact that the baggage is undroppable.
