> Back in 2004, Edward Tufte defined and developed the concept of a "sparkline." Odds are good that --- if you're reading this --- you're familiar with them and how popular they've become.

> What's interesting is that over 20 years before sparklines came on the scene, Tufte developed a different type of data visualization that didn't fare nearly as well. To date, in fact, I've only been able to find *three* examples of it, and even they aren't completely in line with his vision.

I've only skim-read it, but *[The Visual Display of Quantitative Information]* is an excellent book. The Slopegraph (or Table-Graphic) is a great example of Tufte's work. I love that the entire chart is data; if it were printed, not one drop of ink would be wasted.

Brian Suda's book *[A Practical Guide to Designing with Data]* beat into me that any piece of data design should have as little 'ink' as possible; however, it is so rarely possible to achieve 100% data.
