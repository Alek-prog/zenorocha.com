title: Garlic.js&#58; Persistent Form Data

Everyone's been stung by this at least once: You accidentally close your browser or hit the back button, and form data you had entered is gone.

Guillaume Potier:

> Garlic.js allows you to automatically persist your forms' text and select field values locally, until the form is submitted. This way, your users don't lose any precious data if they accidentally close their tab or browser.

It uses [Local Storage] to save data entered into forms, until successful submission. You can set certain fields to not persist; maybe credit card or password fields.

Seems like something worth looking at for any reasonable sized form.
