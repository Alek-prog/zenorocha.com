<p>I got married a couple of weeks ago and had a 'photo booth'.</p>

<p>It was a pretty simple setup. Nikon D90 on a tripod with a SB-900 strobe on camera. The strobe had a globe diffuser and the camera was teathered to a laptop using the free <a href="http://www.sofortbildapp.com/">Sofortbild</a> mac software.</p>

<p>The camera was set to three second timer and a Nikon IR remote trigger was used to fire it.Â The laptop and software were used to show the last photo taken.</p>

<p>We got heaps of amazing shots. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andytlr/sets/72157624367418284/">Some of the best are public on Flickr</a>. Couldn't recommend it more to anyone having a big party or event.</p>
