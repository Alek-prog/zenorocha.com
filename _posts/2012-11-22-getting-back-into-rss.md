title: Getting Back Into RSS
link:
---

Lots of people use Twitter instead of RSS these days. I've been in that camp for at least three years, but I've recently got back into to RSS.

I used to subscribe to lots of high volume, multi-author sites. Seeing '1000+' on my Google Reader tab every day was overwhelming. Eventually my usage dwindled to the point where I only had a look every couple of months.

I now read a different kind of site; lower volume, usually with a single author. I can subscribe to about twenty of these for every one, high volume site.

And so I purchased [Reeder for Mac][] and decided to give RSS another go. Here's a few principles I went by:

* Favour low volume
* Favour individuals
* Favour original content
* Avoid links blogs with little or no commentary
* Know who you're reading; rename feeds to include the author
* Don't hesitate to unsubscribe

Here's a tip: Mark everything as read. After one day, if a feed has more than five new items, consider unsubscribing. It's worth it.
