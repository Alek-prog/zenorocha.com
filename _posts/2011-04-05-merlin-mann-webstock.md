Merlin's talk *Scared Shitless: How I (Mostly) Learned to Love Being Afraid of Pretty Much Everything* was brilliant---watch it. Also check out the [other talks][ot].

I'm amazed that lots of conferences seem to be putting their talks on the Internet, for free. Sounds like Webstock was well and truly worth going to.
