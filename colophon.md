This site is built with [Jekyll], a 'blog aware, static site generator', and hosted on [GitHub Pages]. The source code is version controlled with [Git] and stored on [GitHub].

All the content is written in [Markdown]; [John Gruber]'s excellent 'text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers'.

It is typeset in [FF Tisa Web Pro]---a beautiful screen typeface---and [Adobe Source Code Pro]. Both are served from [TypeKit][][^1].

[^1]: At some point I would like to license Tisa and host it myself. Adobe Source Code Pro is freely available.

It is built using a mobile first, responsive methodology. It has no polyfill for older versions of IE; they simply get the small screen version---acceptable enough.
